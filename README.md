# Career Village Challenge!

# Description:

CareerVillage is a website that is similar to Quora and Stackoverflow. They allow students to post questions about anything related to their future careers. Volunteers with expertise in various fields then answer their questions. Currently, the website lets professionals follow specific topics (programming, finance, engineering, Python, sports...etc). Then, when students post questions, they specify the topic related to their question and once the question is posted, an email notification is sent to the professional who is following that topic. The website is looking for a more efficient way to send these recommendation questions. The goal of the challenge is to develop a method to recommend relevant questions to the professionals who are most likely to answer them (fast).


## Project Plan and Outline:

Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
- In this part we explored the data and made visualizations to understand the common patterns and trendes

Part 2: NLP for feature engineering:
- The dataset of questions and answers needed to be narrowed down to a state where features can be engineered for our model.

Part 3: Data Manipulation, prepartion and modeling:
- In this part, we conducted features enegineering to exctract interesting features and prepare the data for a neural network model

Part 4: Simulation and perofrmance assessment:
- To have a realisitic test of the model beyond the usual accuracy metric, we conducted a simulation that generated random questions and tested the model's performance at finding the right people to answer the questions.
